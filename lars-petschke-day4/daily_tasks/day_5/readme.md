# 🚀 Day 5 – Project Wrap-up & GitHub Deployment

Today’s mission: **move your project to your personal GitHub repository** and make it public. This is your chance to organize and present your work as a complete, professional portfolio project.

You’ll be restructuring, documenting, and finalizing everything from the past four days — with a focus on clarity, code quality, and storytelling.

---

## 🧠 Task Summary

Here’s what to do:

- ✅ **Clone or copy the project to your personal GitHub repo**
  - Create a **new public repository** under your personal account
  - Use a clean, descriptive name like `nyc-schools-analysis` or similar

- ✅ **Restructure your folders** to reflect the *actions* you performed, not the day labels  
  For example:
- 📁 nyc-schools-analysis/ ← Main project folder (GitHub repo root) <br>
├── 📁 incident_analysis/ ← Former Day 1 <br>
│ └── README.md ← Explains task + key findings <br>
│ └── data/ ← Any related raw/cleaned data <br>
│ <br>
├── 📁 school_directory_exploration/ ← Former Day 2 <br>
│ └── README.md ← Task description + insights <br>
│ └── visuals/ ← Bar charts or summaries <br>
│ └── notebook.ipynb <br>
│ <br>
├── 📁 database_queries/ ← Former Day 3 <br>
│ └── README.md ← SQL queries via Python + outcomes <br>
│ └── queries.ipynb <br>
│ <br>
├── 📁 database_population/ ← Former Day 4 <br>
│ └── README.md ← Data cleaning + upload logic <br>
│ └── cleaned_data.csv <br>
│ └── upload_script.py <br>
│ <br>
├── 📁 assets/ ← Optional: project visuals, screenshots <br>
│
├── requirements.txt ← Dependencies list <br>
├── environment.yml ← (Optional) Conda environment file <br>
├── README.md ← Full project overview and summary <br>

## ⏳ Estimated Time

**3–5 hours**

Focus on polish, presentation, and professional delivery. You’ve already done the heavy lifting — now package it into something you're proud to share!

---

## 📣 Final Tip

**Each folder should have its own README** explaining the task and results — and your **main README** should tell the story of the overall project. Treat your documentation like it’s part of your portfolio — because it is. 🧠💬
