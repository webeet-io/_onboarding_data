## 🔧 How We Will Work with GitHub

### 🧑‍💻 Branch Structure

- Each intern will work in their **own personal branch**:  
  `[your-name]`
  
- For each daily task, create a **sub-branch** from your personal branch:  
  `[your-name]/day-1`, `[your-name]/day-2`, etc.

### 📝 Issues and Tasks

- Every task will be issued as a **GitHub Issue**.
- Interns must **comment on the issue** once they’ve submitted their daily work via Pull Request.

### 🔁 Pull Requests

- Submit a **Pull Request** (PR) from your daily sub-branch into your **personal branch**.
- Tag your PR with the issue number (`Closes #X`) so it’s linked to the correct task.
- Submit your PR **each day** for review by Anastasia or Kai.
