While in pursuit of knowledge about other world regions, including their histories, economies and world languages, students acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare for college and/or careers. Teachers and other adults who make up the learning community forge supportive relationships with students and parents while providing challenging and engaging learning experiences. Our school partners with various community, arts and business organizations to help students achieve success. Our theme of international studies extends beyond the classroom, where students participate in ongoing ‚ÄòAdvisory Day Out‚Äô excursions where the multiculturalism of NYC becomes the classroom.",
