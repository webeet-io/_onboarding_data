We use real-world learning by giving our students experiences in local healthcare settings before they graduate. Students gain practical skills including CPR and first aid, explore careers through 11th grade internships at local medical centers, and take early college coursework with our university partners. These hands-on opportunities both provide a context for language acquisition and allow students to use their native language as an asset in their service to the community.",
