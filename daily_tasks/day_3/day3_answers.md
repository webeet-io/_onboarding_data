Observations and Findings

**[Q1] How many schools are there in each borough?**

- Brooklyn has the highest number of high schools (121), followed by the Bronx (118), Manhattan (106), Queens (80), and Staten Island (10).
- This distribution shows that most schools are located in Brooklyn and the Bronx, while Staten Island has the fewest.

**[Q2] What is the average % of English Language Learners (ELL) per borough?**

- Due to data limitations, demographic data (including ELL percentages) is only available for Manhattan in this database.
- As a result, the average ELL percentage could only be calculated for Manhattan schools.
- The findings here may not represent the whole city, but demonstrate how to approach the analysis.

**[Q3] Which are the top 3 schools in each borough with the highest % of special education students?**

- Again, only Manhattan has the required demographic data for this calculation.
- The top 3 Manhattan schools with the highest percentage of special education students were identified and visualized.
- For other boroughs, the absence of data is clearly shown in the results table.

**General Notes and Insights:**

- The analysis demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database, write SQL queries in Python, join tables, and visualize results.
- Data limitations restricted detailed analysis to Manhattan only, but the workflow and queries can be reused if more data becomes available.
- Visualizations (bar chart and lollipop chart) effectively highlighted both distributions and top-ranked schools.
