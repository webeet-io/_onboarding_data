# ðŸ“Ž NYC Schools Portfolio Project

ðŸ”— **Public GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/marinaG1717/nyc-schools-analysis](https://github.com/marinaG1717/nyc-schools-analysis)

This repository contains my cleaned, documented, and organized portfolio version of the NYC Schools Data Analysis project. It includes:

1. **Incident Analysis** â€“ Examining patterns in school safety incidents.  
2. **School Directory Exploration** â€“ Understanding school distribution, size, and grade spans across boroughs.  
3. **Database Queries** â€“ Using SQL (via Python) to answer questions from the integrated datasets.  
4. **Database Population & SAT Results** â€“ Cleaning and integrating SAT data into a PostgreSQL database.  

The goal of this project is to **practice data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and SQL integration**, while producing insights that could inform school policy and planning.
