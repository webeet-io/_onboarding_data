## Observations / Insights

> - The Bronx dominates incident counts: 4 of the top 5 locations are in the Bronx.  
> - Distribution is highly skewed: most schools report only a few incidents, while a handful drive the totals upward.  
> - Standard deviation is larger than the mean, confirming strong outliers and long-tail behavior.

## Notes on Method

> - Cleaned headers in Google Sheets (lowercase, spaces â†’ `_`, removed special characters).  
> - Computed `total_incidents` as sum of `major_n`, `oth_n`, `nocrim_n`, `prop_n`, and `vio_n`.  
> - Used Google Sheets `QUERY` functions to group data, rank schools (Top-5), and calculate borough shares.  
> - Calculated summary statistics (mean, standard deviation) on schools with >0 incidents.
