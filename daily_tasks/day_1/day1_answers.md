## 2) Data Cleaning Process

### Step 1 – Load Dataset

- Replaced all “N/A” values with blanks (to keep structure consistent).

- Ensured no columns were deleted — only cleaned.

### Step 3 – Validation
- Confirmed that Borough, Address, and Range columns remain aligned.
- Double-checked total row count: **6,310 → 2,538 visible rows** after cleaning.
