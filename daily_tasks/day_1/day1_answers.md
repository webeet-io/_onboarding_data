- There is a discrepancy of 382 unique identifiers for schools between the columns "DBN" and "Location name".
  In total 15,9% of the data in the DBN column is missing.
  There might be a correlation between missing data in DBN and Location Code column. Both columns are missing the data in the same rows, except that Location Code has one more missing value.
