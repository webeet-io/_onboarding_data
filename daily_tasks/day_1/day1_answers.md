### Answers:
a) 6311 rows
b) 1890 unique schools, if i count unique dbn numbers ( this number is not 100 % correct, as it does not take into account entries where dbn is missing). However most missing dbn entries, belongs to the same school.
c) Non-criminal icidents 11670 are most common which make sense
d) 26.370 total number of crimes (all incindents, if i summ all crime columns, coliumns N-Q ). However if filter, only Bronx in the borough name column i receive 7,466. Percentage (7466/26370)*100=28.31%
### Observations:
It is interesting to mention that certain clusters of schools completely or only for several years lack total crimi statistics (N/A). Where it is done on purpose or ocassionally is difficult to say
