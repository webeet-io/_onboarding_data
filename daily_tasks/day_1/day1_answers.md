üîó [My Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ob3hDyIP4TibufZ9w9cT78nHgCEcpgSFHgL-wk3YQhI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Answers:
- Total rows: 6,310  
- Unique schools: 1,890  
- Most frequent incident type: ‚ÄúNoCrim N incidents‚Äù (11,772 cases)  
- Bronx incident %: 24.7%  

### Observations:
- Non-criminal incidents (NoCrim N) make up the majority of all cases.  
- Nearly 25% of all incidents occurred in the Bronx.  
- A few schools stand out with unusually high numbers of incidents, such as:  
  1. 800 EAST GUN HILL ROAD CONSOLIDATED LOCATION ‚Äî 326  
  2. 100 WEST MOSHOLU PARKWAY SOUTH CONSOLIDATED LOCATION ‚Äî 302  
  3. 99 TERRACE VIEW AVENUE CONSOLIDATED LOCATION ‚Äî 296  
- Some rows contain N/A values in incident columns, which could indicate missing or inconsistent reporting.  
- The distribution of incidents across schools is highly uneven: most schools report very few cases, but a handful of schools show hundreds of incidents.  
- Very high incident counts in a few schools may reflect either real safety challenges or differences in how incidents are reported (e.g., stricter reporting standards).
