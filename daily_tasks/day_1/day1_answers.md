### Answers:
Total Rows: 6,310
Unique Schools: 2,272
Most Frequent Incident Type: nocrim_n (Non-criminal incidents)
Total Count of This Type: 11,772
% of Incidents in the Bronx: 24.67%

### Observations:
There are some notable outliers: for example, some schools reported up to 84 non-criminal incidents (with a mean of just 3.3), and up to 29 'other' incidents (mean 1.9). In total, 858 schools (about 14%) reported zero incidents in all categories.

There's a significant disparity by borough: Brooklyn reported the highest number of major incidents (554), while Staten Island reported the lowest (64)â€”an 8.7 times difference.
