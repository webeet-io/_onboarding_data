**🎯 Objective**  
The goal of this task was to explore a real dataset about **school safety incidents in New York City**, perform basic data cleaning, and answer a few analytical questions using **Google Sheets**.  
This exercise helped me learn how to handle missing values, calculate totals and percentages, and identify interesting trends in the data.  

**🧹 Data Cleaning Process**  
Before starting the analysis, I cleaned the dataset with the following steps:  
- Removed **empty rows** and unnecessary blank cells.  
- Checked for **“N/A” values** and made sure they didn’t affect my calculations.  
- Kept all important columns related to incidents (Major N, Oth N, NoCrim N, Prop N, Vio N).  
- Verified that the **Borough Name** column contained all five regions (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island).  

After cleaning, the dataset became easier to read and ready for analysis.  

**✅ Analytical Answers**

1️⃣ Total number of rows: 
→ 6,310  

2️⃣ Number of unique schools: 
→ 1891  

3️⃣ Most frequent incident type: 
→ “NoCrim N” (Non-criminal or minor incidents)  

4️⃣ Percentage of incidents that occurred in the Bronx: 
→ 24.68 %  

5️⃣ Interesting findings / anomalies:
- Some schools in the Bronx report **much higher incidents** than others with similar size.  
- The **“NoCrim N”** type makes up the majority of all incidents, showing that most events are **non-criminal issues** (like fights or behavioral problems).  
- A few schools have **zero incidents** reported, which may indicate **missing or incomplete data**, not necessarily perfect safety.

**💡 Observations and Insights**

1️⃣ High number of incidents in Bronx
Bronx schools have a noticeably higher share of incidents (around 28%), suggesting that this area might have higher student density or different reporting patterns.  

2️⃣ Most incidents are minor  
The majority of reported cases are labeled as “NoCrim N”, meaning most school events are related to discipline or minor conflicts rather than serious crimes.  

3️⃣ Possible data inconsistency
Some schools with “0 incidents” could reflect missing reports.  
It shows how important **data quality** is in real-world datasets.

**📝 Summary**
This first day task helped me get comfortable with **Google Sheets formulas** and **basic data exploration**.  
I learned how to apply filters, count unique values, calculate percentages, and write short observations.  
It was a simple but very practical introduction to how real-world datasets look and how to work with them effectively.
