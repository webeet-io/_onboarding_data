## Observations
- Bronx schools account for about 28.2% of all incidents, which is a significant share of the total.
- The majority of reported incidents are nocrim_n suggesting schools mainly deal with lower-level issues rather than violent or property-related cases.
- Some schools show unusually high numbers of incidents compared to others of similar size — this could be due to either differences in reporting practices or genuine behavioral issues.
