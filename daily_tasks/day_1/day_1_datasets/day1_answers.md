1 - 6322 rows
2 - 1890 (further elaboration inside sheet comments)
3 - non criminal incidents (")
4 - 28.24%
5 - see pivot tables .1 findings 1: Brooklyn crimepercentage is the highest even though bronx maybe has a higher percentage in our answer before - but this table only focuses on the school related cases and brooklynis likely probably the biggest chunk of schools. It may differ  more in specific parts. Brooklyn is known for being a melting pot of diversity so it may have many smaller issues i didn't dig too deep yet but may say bronx has some well now highly dangerous parts in the south.

5.2 finding2 : well a surprise finding! a school in staten island is the leader of notorious schools while staten has the lowest sum that one school is more than 30% of that region

(feedback notes, it was unclear how elaborated the answers here should be if they a should be as clean as possible ore more elaborated. Also the git instructions were good but i misunderstood than when copying a repo it clones the whole and not just my branch , so i had to redo this and hope everthing is fine now and before i wrongly parsed just day-1, assuming it was a subfolder inside my branch, in here instead name-day-1 )
