    "   - a) How many total schools are in Brooklyn? (use the method that counts only unique values. Also there is a column that has a unique identifier for schools.)\n",
    "   - b) How many schools in Brooklyn offer Grade 9 entry? (here you need to use range to get the correct answer for example just stating min_grade entry >=9 will miss the schools that offer earlier entry))\n",

    "5. Group and summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a) Count of schools per borough (again unique schools)\n",
    "    - b) Average number of students per borough\n",
    "    - c) Summary of grade_span_max grouped by borough (use the method that provides you with basic statistics about that column)\n",
