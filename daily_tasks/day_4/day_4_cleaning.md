# üß© Day 4 - Cleaning logic explanation

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1

* Removing one instance of the SAT Reading Avg Result column which was there twice
* Checking wether all schools (dbn) appear in the high_school_directory table - if so, the school_name column could have been removed to save storage. Sadly, not the case

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1.2
Removed the following columns due to irrelevance.

* internal school id: since there's already an unique identifier with the dbn and the internal school id is generated by the DOE only for there internal use
* contact extension: is a phone number extension. not relevant for any analysis
* pct_students_tested: this column can easily be calculated with the number of total students and the number of students who got tested
* academic tear rating: the rating doesn't use an appearent pattern. Since there is no official unified school ranking in nyc or the us in general and its not comprehensive what this rating is based on, its getting dropped

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2

* Checking for duplicate rows and wether or not these duplicates are 'full' duplicates or if there is multiple entries for some schools - only full duplicates appeared
* removed all duplicate rows (kept first)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3 

* Checked for missing values - there were none, BUT many test results were 'supressed' and therefore as bad as missing values (or even worse)
* replaced all 's' values in the effected columns with nan. Didn't want to put in 'false' values

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4

* Updated data types of Result-related columns - due to the 's' entries they were present as data type object. Converted them into float64

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Step 5

* Updated column names according to the tasks of the preceding days

## NEW DATASET

* dbn: unique identifier for each school containing information about location and stuff
* school_name: name of the schools
* num_of_sat_test_takers: total number of students participating in the test of each school
* sat_critical_reading_avg_score: Avg score for that test per school
* sat_math_avg_score: Avg score for that test per school
* sat_writing_avg_score: Avg score for that test per school
