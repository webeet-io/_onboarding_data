# 🧠 Day 3 – SQL via Python: NYC School Data Exploration

Welcome to **Day 3**! Today, you’ll learn to run SQL queries from within Python — a powerful combo for analysis, automation, and real-world workflows at Webeet.

---

## 🎯 Task Summary

You’ll be working with a PostgreSQL database containing NYC school data. Your goals:

- Connect to the database using Python
- Write SQL queries and fetch results into `pandas` DataFrames
- Analyze school patterns across boroughs, demographics, and safety metrics
- Submit your findings in a Jupyter Notebook

This reflects how we often work at Webeet — combining data access and analysis in one environment.

## 🗃️ Database Tables

You’ll be querying these tables:

- `high_school_directory` – School names, locations, types, programs
- `school_demographics` – Enrollment data, ELL, FRPL, disabilities, etc.
- `school_safety_report` – Reported incidents by type and location.
  
You can find description of these tables here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-GBa4-i2ZJqc3lWVuefVKwS6o7jVHu2WWMRBEcJn-y8/edit?usp=sharing

## 🔌 Connecting to the Database
Clone repo to your local machine. 
Set up your connection in Python using one of the following as provided in the the setup guide:  
📁 `daily_tasks/day_3/day3_sql_combined_with_creds.ipynb`
Make sure that connection works and you can query the data.
