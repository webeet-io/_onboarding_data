We provide an education rich in math, science, technology, literature, world history and current events. Students conduct original research, tour museums and explore New York's cultural life. Each grade takes an annual, overnight trip — freshmen participate in Living Environment labs in the wilderness of Upstate New York and upperclassmen visit colleges. Hands-on learning, supportive relationships, small classes, individual attention and regular tutoring are the underpinnings of a program focused on developing the skills required for success in college.",

This great tradition and the legacy of our namesake still resonate at Lincoln today. Abraham Lincoln High School is a community where all members help one another pursue their potential. Through our partnership with Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, we offer Small Learning Communities (SLC). Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to discuss and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of SLC, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school. We offer a state-of-the-art photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, multiple computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums and a swimming pool. Our extensive elective course offerings, including Advanced Placement and College Now classes, empower our academic achievers to complete up to a year of college credit during their secondary studies.
